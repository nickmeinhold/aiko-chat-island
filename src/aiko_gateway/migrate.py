"""Bring the database to head — the container entrypoint runs this BEFORE uvicorn.

Why an explicit runner (not just `alembic upgrade head`): the gateway adopted
alembic AFTER a live DB already existed, built by the old ``create_all`` path.
That live DB has every table but no ``alembic_version`` row, so a naive
``upgrade head`` would run the baseline's ``CREATE TABLE users`` against a DB that
already has it and abort. The fix is **stamp-or-upgrade**:

  * fresh DB (no ``alembic_version``, no ``users``)      → ``upgrade head`` builds it
  * pre-alembic DB (``users`` present, no ``alembic_version``) → adopt: VERIFY the
        existing schema matches the baseline, then ``stamp 0001``, then
        ``upgrade head`` applies anything after it
  * already-managed DB (``alembic_version`` present)     → ``upgrade head`` only

**The adoption is fail-closed (Carnot cage-match, PR#23).** Stamping is an
assertion that "the schema on disk already equals revision 0001". We do NOT take
that on faith from the mere presence of a ``users`` table — a DB that is missing a
table, or has a half-applied/partial schema, would otherwise be falsely marked
"current" and, with ``create_all`` gone, never repaired. So before stamping we run
alembic's own metadata comparison against the ORM and REFUSE to stamp on any
drift, surfacing the diff for an operator. (The one pre-alembic DB that exists —
prod — was verified table-for-table to match the baseline before this shipped;
this check encodes that verification so a future ambiguous DB fails loud instead
of being silently corrupted.)

There is no host orchestrator to sequence "migrate before boot" (the deploy is a
manual ``docker compose up -d`` — see aiko_chat_gateway#19), so this MUST run in
the container entrypoint. It fails closed: any error propagates a non-zero exit
and the entrypoint never starts uvicorn on an unmigrated schema.

Concurrency note: the deploy runs a single gateway replica, so exactly one
migrator touches the (single-writer) SQLite file at a time. The adoption logic is
NOT safe against two migrators racing one fresh SQLite file (SQLite DDL is not
fully transactional); if this service is ever scaled, gate migrations behind a
one-shot init container or an explicit lock rather than the per-replica entrypoint.

    be diffed against THAT, not against the live ORM models (``Base.metadata``):
    the models track HEAD, so every post-baseline migration that adds something
    ``compare_metadata`` can see (e.g. 0003's ``device_tokens`` table) would make a
    genuine baseline-era DB falsely look "drifted" and be wrongly refused. (0002's
    CHECK-only revision masked this because compare_metadata is blind to CHECKs on
    SQLite — a table addition is the first post-baseline change it can detect.)

    We materialise 0001 once in a temp SQLite file by pointing the app's DB_URL at
    it for the single ``upgrade`` call (env.py derives the target from
    settings.db_url; restored in ``finally``), then reflect it. Reflecting BOTH
