"""Migration correctness (#14) — the gate that replaces dead CI.

Three properties, each a way the migration system could silently lie:

1. **Parity** — ``alembic upgrade head`` on a fresh DB must build the SAME schema
   as the ORM models (``create_all``). Without this, a model change without a
   matching revision drifts the live DB from the code invisibly. This is the
   check ``alembic check`` / a CI autogenerate-diff would run; we run it as a unit
   test because there is no CI (aiko_chat_gateway#18).

2. **Fresh upgrade** — an empty DB upgrades to a complete, alembic-managed schema.

3. **Adopt** — a PRE-alembic DB (built by the old ``create_all`` path: all tables,
   no ``alembic_version``) is adopted by stamping the baseline, NOT by trying to
   re-create existing tables (which would abort). This is the exact situation of
   the live prod DB at the moment this ships.

All three drive the real entrypoint runner (``aiko_gateway.migrate.run``) and the
real ``alembic/env.py`` against a throwaway file SQLite DB, so they exercise the
shipped code path, not a reimplementation.
